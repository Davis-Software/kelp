# Kelp Wishlist

This file contains features which were requested by the community or other sources and are planned to be implemented into one of the next Kelp releases.

Before you create a new feature request, please make sure your idea has not already been posted in this wishlist to avoid duplicates.

## Features on the wishlist:

* `KelpCommand#inheritSettingsFromParent()`: Settings like permissions, messages, etc. do not have to be set in every sub command but can be inherited by the main command.
* Add more unit tests where possible
* Use caffeine as caching method
* Create listeners for every player via the `KelpPlayer` class
* Add server performance optimization tool
